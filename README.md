# DirectoryBot
DirectoryBot is a configurable, multi-language bot that stores friend codes and converts timezones.

## Set-Up
1. Add DirectoryBot to your server from this link: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=585336216262803456&permissions=27648&scope=bot
2. Move the DirectoryBot role above any roles you'd like it to be able to automatically add (new roles get added at the bottom)

### Optional
* Use "@DirectoryBot setpermissionsrole (role)" to store the permissions role. This allows the bot to interpret accidental mentions of the role as command messages.
* Record your information for DirectoryBot's default platforms: time zone, possessive pronoun, and stream.
* Check out the Imaginary Horizons Productions Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/imaginaryhorizonsproductions

### Notes
If you leave a server, DirectoryBot will delete all of your data. If you kick DirectoryBot, it will delete everyone's data.

## General Commands
To interact with DirectoryBot, mention the bot then type one of these commands:
### Record, Log, Add
This command adds your information for given platform so people can ask the bot for it.
#### Recording data
`@DirectoryBot record (platform) (data)`
The message containing the command will be deleted for security purposes. Discord's spoilers markdown (|| on both sides) is removed from code entry to allow hiding entry from mobile via spoilers markdown.

### Import
This command copies your data for matching platforms from a given server.
#### Importing data
`@DirectoryBot import (channel mention or snowflake from source server)`
There are two ways to indicate which server to import from: by mentioning a channel from that server, or by providing the server's snowflake.

To get a channel mention, start a message in the server you want to import from. Start with #, then autocomplete. You can then copy-paste the blue link into your command in the destination server.

To get a server's snowflake, first activate Developer Mode in your User Settings. Then you can right-click on the source server and select "Copy ID" from the drop-down menu.

Converting time zones for users is not available via private messages.
