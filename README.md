# DirectoryBot
DirectoryBot is a Discord bot that stores friend codes and converts timezones.

## Set-Up
1. Add DirectoryBot to your server from this link: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=585336216262803456&permissions=27648&scope=bot
2. Move the DirectoryBot role above any roles you'd like it to be able to automatically add (new roles get added at the bottom)

### Optional
* Use "@DirectoryBot setpermissionsrole (role)" to store the permissions role. This allows the bot to interpret accidental mentions of the role as command messages.
* Use "@DirectoryBot setmanagerrole (role)" to set up a manager role. Bot managers are allowed to use manager-only commands without Discord administrator permissions.
* Use "@DirectoryBot welcomemessage (welcome message)" to set a message to send to new server members.
* Record your information for DirectoryBot's default platforms: time zone, possessive pronoun, and stream.

## General Commands
